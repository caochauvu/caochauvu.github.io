<h2>Distance-Based Phylogenetic Reconstruction Review and Background</h2>
<p><strong>Bird's Eye View</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sequence Data $\rightarrow$ Distance Values $\rightarrow$ Phylogenetic Tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Clustering Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UPGMA</li>
<li>NJ (fast and good)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Review of Tree Terminology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tree</strong> Graph without cycles.<ul>
<li>Use to represent phylogenies. </li>
<li>Can be drawn an different way without changing relationships, e.g. rotating branches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nodes</strong> represent an ancestor<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> nodes represent a hypothetical ancestor.</li>
<li><strong>Root</strong> node has no ancestors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Branches (edges)</strong> can be weighted or unweighted, where weighted is representative of a value (e.g. time, # of mutations).</li>
<li>Number of branches attached to a node is called node's degree. <ul>
<li>A terminal node will have be degree one (one ancestor).</li>
<li>A non-root ancestor with two descendants will be degree three (two descendants, one ancestor).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cladogram:</strong> Tree where the branch (edge) length doesn't matter.</li>
<li><strong>Additive Tree:</strong> A tree with meaningful branch (edge) length. Usually branch length is a representation of "amount of evolutionary change" (most of the time it's expected # of substitutions per site).</li>
<li><strong>Ultrametric tree (dendrogram):</strong> An additive tree with a specific constraint on branch lengths. It's like a additive tree that looks like a cladogram in terms of all tips node being the same distance from root. Good for algorithmic purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Rooted trees:</strong> Trees where special node (root) that is an ancestor to other nodes. Root node immediately defines direction of evolution from root to terminal nodes (usually left to right or bottom to top).</li>
<li><strong>Unrooted trees:</strong> Have no root node. <ul>
<li>Advantage is that you don't make an assumption of where the root is.</li>
<li>However, rooted trees are more useful, so we need a way to convert unrooted trees to a rooted trees.</li>
<li>We can pick any point on a unrooted tree (any branch) and turn it into a root.</li>
<li>Numbers of branches in an unrooted tree will tell you how many possible rooted trees you can have.</li>
<li>Each edge in the unrooted tree defines a split.</li>
<li>Usually we pick a root where we can keep groups together. E.g. you would not pick a root to be on one of the two descendants of a internal node because it would split them up and allows us to better preserve relationships, they make more "interesting trees".</li>
<li>To know where to make a root node for sure, we need to use external data, like an outgroup. Or evolutionary data (e.g. # of substitutions) from an ultrametric tree.</li>
<li>To unrooten a tree, you just need to straighten out the root node to get a general idea of what the unrooted tree would look like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trees Files Formats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main one we'll encounter is the Newick format.</li>
<li>Trees can be compactly represented during nested parentheses</li>
<li>Each internal node is represented by enclosed parentheses around the descendants of that node.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. </p>
<p>A tree with one root node and two internal nodes each with two terminal nodes (four descendants total) would be represented as:</p>
<p>$$
((A,B),(C,D))
$$</p>
<p>For one with one root node leading to one terminal and one internal node, of which that internal node has another terminal node and an internal node with two terminal node of its own, would be represented as:</p>
<p>$$
(((A,B),C),D)
$$</p>
<p>Branch lengths can also be stored in the file format. Say we have a the same tree as the first example with different edge lengths (mutation rates) of .2, .1, .25, .05 respectively for A,B,C,D and an edge length of .3 and .21 respectively for the two internal nodes, it would be represented as:</p>
<p>$$
((A:0.2,B:0.1):0.3,(C:0.25,D:0.05):0.21)
$$</p>
<h2>Least-Squares Methods</h2>
<p>For each candidate tree $\tau$, find branch length that minimizes </p>
<p>[\sum_{i &lt; j} (d_{ij}-e_{ij})^2]</p>
<p>We'll call this minimum $L(\tau)$. So our goal is to get the minimum $L(\tau)$.</p>
<h2>Minimum evolution</h2>
<p>Same as in L-squared method, you find smallest $L(\tau)$</p>
<p>But now we are looking for trees with smallest # of evolutionary change overall.</p>
